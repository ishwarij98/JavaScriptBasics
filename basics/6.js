// Loops in Javascript

/*

Loops : Loops are basicallly iterations when you 
execute a statement repeatedly multiple times

Executing a block of code multiple
times is called iterations

//There are two types of loops
1. Entry controlled Loops
2. Exit controlled Loops

1. Entry controlled Loops
there is a condition to Stop the loop at starting itself
of the loop and the condition is true
then only it will enter the loop like if statement
 condition ..this is known as entry controlled loop

 2. Exit controlled loops
 In the exit controlled lopps
 the termination of loops is written after the loop 
 which is known as exit controlled loops

 The main difference between is the termination of a loop

1. Entry controlled Loop terminates the loop immediately
when the condition becomes false

2. Exit controlled Loop terminates the loop after the
loop completes its execution

In both cases the loop will start only if the condition is true


In Entry controlled loops
1. for Loop
2. while Loop

In Exit controlled loops
1. do-while Loop
*/

// //For Loop --> check the condition--> increment the value
// for(let i=0; i<=10; i++) {
// console.log(i);
// }

// //While Loop 
// let j = 0;
// while(j <= 10) {
// console.log(j);
// j++;
// }

// //Do-While Loop
// let k = 12;
// do {

// console.log(k);
// k++;
// } while(k <= 10);
